TextureConverter.py - code for converting IUV atlases to blender/unity texture. Check tests.py on how to use
VideoTexturer.py - code for running through the folder of DensePose outputs and collecting an IUV atlas
tests.py - tests 
Other files are required for TextureConverter.py
TextureConverter.py works much faster after all IUV-UV map is precomputed (rather than computing every time). 
Ask me for the link for precomputed.pkl
Also ask me for the folder with DensePose outputs
